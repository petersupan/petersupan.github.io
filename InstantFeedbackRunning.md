# Instant Feedback running

I was frustrated by the fact that there exist so many gadgets for running, which measure parameters related to running technique, but none of them gives immediate, actionable feedback. They all give averaged analytical data to look at after the run, which makes it hard to iterate.

So I decided to explore the possibilites to do this myself. Goal was to provide feedback on one step in running fast enough so that adaptions could be made in the next step, either visually or acoustic.
